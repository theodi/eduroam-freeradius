# Installing the server

This configuration broadly follows the guide on the FreeRadius wiki at https://wiki.freeradius.org/guide/eduroam

On Ubuntu you will also need

` apt-get install freeradius mysql-server

## Extra steps

1. Create the certificates

Either copy these from an existing server, or type *make* in the certs directory

2. Configure mysql

# Notes

It uses SQL as the backend and passwords must be NT-Passwords to get the best compatabilty while still being hashed.

The tests are also in here along with a copy of eapol-test compiled x64 for ubuntu 20.04

Obviously you need to go through everywhere and change the passwords!
